# Introduction #

The project should ease the creation of large demo and test repositories. It creates a defined number of nodes below an Alfresco folder.

The nodes are either pushed all into a single folder or distributed among a folder dynamically created folder hierarchy.
The tool is intended to be used for the preparation of load test repos and to ease the testing of customizations on a bigger repository.

It created 500000 nodes in less then 1 hour on a i7 test laptop.
